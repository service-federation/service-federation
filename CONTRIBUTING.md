2. Describe the use case and why existing features don't meet your needs
3. Be open to discussion about alternative approaches

### Pull Requests

2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure tests pass (`cargo test`)
5. Ensure code is formatted (`cargo fmt`)
6. Ensure clippy is happy (`cargo clippy`)
7. Commit your changes with a descriptive message

## Code Style

- Follow standard Rust conventions
- Run `cargo fmt` before committing
- Run `cargo clippy` and address any warnings
- Write tests for new functionality
- Add doc comments for complex logic

## Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages that describe what the change does:

```

- Implement retry logic for failed health checks
- Add configurable backoff parameters
- Update documentation
```

## Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for new functions
- Write integration tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests continue to pass
- Docker-related tests should be marked with `#[ignore]` and include `// Requires Docker` comment

## Architecture Overview

The codebase is organized as follows:

- `src/config/` - Configuration parsing and validation
- `src/service/` - Service managers (Docker, Process, Gradle, etc.)
- `src/orchestrator/` - Service orchestration and lifecycle management
- `src/session/` - Session management for port stability
- `src/state/` - State persistence (SQLite-based)
- `src/tui/` - Terminal UI implementation
- `src/commands/` - CLI command implementations
